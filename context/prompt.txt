- Use the .tex template to create an annotated greek text for publishing
- Parse the following Greek text to identify lemmas
- Create frequency-based vocabulary annotation (ONLY words outside top 1000 most common lemmas) 
- Provide ONLY context-appropriate glosses for the text rather than the most common gloss for any lemma
- Generate glosses with grammatical parsing.
- Footnote format: "λέγω, say, speak, 3rd sg. impf. act. ind."
- Format EVERYTHING as a clean, editable LaTeX section (do not include other LaTeX elements or formatting instructions.)
- Do not wrap the latex code in quotes. 
- Provide only the sections of text with footnotes - do not add details like a commentary or translation.
